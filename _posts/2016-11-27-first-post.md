This is my first post, how exciting!

Actually this is the second time that I launch a blog. The first one was very professional and in French in order to cover my job as a community manager.

I now live in China and I am fascinated how fast things change around there. I think this blog will mostly talk about IT innovation, electronic payments, coping with the Great Firewall, playing around with a Rasperry Pi among others.

I hope you will enjoy reading as much I'll enjoy sharing and getting feedback from you.
