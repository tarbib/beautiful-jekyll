title: Download an apk of Google Play Store without Google Play Store
---
If you have always purchased your Android devices in a major western market you probably never experienced the pain of having a phone without the Google play store. 

This is particularly true if you bought it in China. I am not very sure of the reasons, it could be because of Google charging a license fee to the manufacturers or simply because Google is blocked in China or a bit of both. Anyway in my experience, I had to look for 国际版 （International version) on Taobao for phones that come pre-installed with play store or sometimes 香港版 (Hong Kong version). 

There is a tool to circumvent this if you do not want to rely on Chinese app store markets (another story) but in my opinion this could only be used as a short-term fix because it will not support updates and it is a bit tedious. There is a website called [apkfind.com](apkfind.com).

You simply have to enter the link of the Google play Store link of the app (or directly the package name) you want in their form then they will provide a link to directly download the app. 
Example : 
Lykke Wallet : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lykkex.LykkeWallet

Apk download link provided by APKfind http://apkfind.com/dl/com.lykkex.LykkeWallet
