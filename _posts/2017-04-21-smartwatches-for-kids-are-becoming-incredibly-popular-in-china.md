## Smartwatches for kids are becoming incredibly popular in China

So I was sitting on the metro when a young girl and her dad came in, he told her to sit next to me. She take out her iPad from her bag (which is rather usual in today's China) then I noticed she had a special watch around her wrist. 
I asked her in Chinese what is this? 
Her dad told her to reply in English, so we had a conversation using both the language we felt the most appropriate for each other : Chinese for me because she is Chinese, and English for her because you know I am... White... 
To sum it up her watch is an android device for kids that not only display time but also :

Have a built-in GPS function to let her dad track her 
A sim card to be called 
Quick contacts to make urgent calls if needed at 0.5 yuan per minute. 

It seems they have special telecommunications subscriptions for this product so that they only pay when calling out. 

She also can play games. 

The watch is old for 688å…ƒ (around 100 USD) on Huawei Offcial store :

Is it becoming popular in the West?
Would you buy it for your kid? 
Would you let him wandering around with permanent radiation while still being few years old?
