title: How I buy movie tickets in China
---
The process of how buying movie tickets in China without leaving Wechat is pretty straightforward and convenient.

Indeed Wechat as a built-in wallet feature, when associated with a bank card, works pretty much like PayPal.

So this article will focus on the "Movie Tickets" section of the wallet.

When you get in, you have access to a list of movies, after selecting the one you want to watch (lalaland in this case), you click on 立即购买（buy now).

Just select in which theater you want to go to. You can select by location, like the nearest to you. You'll be prompted with different timetables and starting price.

When you made your decision on where you want to go, you can choose the specific time and the price associated with.

Here comes my favorite feature, I don't know about your country but when I lived in France we usually had to queue for a while because it's first come, first served basis. Here in China you book your seat in advance. So no more queue, no more not enough seats to sit altogether. 

Then you can place the order and pay with your wechat wallet. You will get a code to withdraw your tickets from the machine.
